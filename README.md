# 📘 60 Days DSA Challenge – UPES 🚀

Welcome to the **60 Days Data Structures & Algorithms Challenge**, initiated by a student of the **UPES Coding Batch**.  

This repository contains **daily C++ solutions** to DSA problems, organized topic-wise and day-wise.  
It’s not just a collection of code – it’s a **journey of discipline, consistency, and growth** in mastering problem solving for **technical interviews, coding contests, and placements**.
